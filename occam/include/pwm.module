--** @module pwm

--WARNING: 20100718 drew This is very much uncompleted code. It's
--  implimentation is going to throw a few sizeable holes in code that's
--  already working elsewhere, which has made me think twice about converting
--  PWM operations to a PROTOCOL-based structure. If usecases that would make
--  this kind of more-complicated, more-robust structure useful arrise, I will
--  definitely push forward with this interface.
