plumb
=======

### Summary

**plumb** runs occam programs on your Arduino. To use **plumb**, you must have an active Internet connection.

**plumb** runs programs on your Arduino through a sequence of steps:

1. Sending your code to a server.
1. The server transforms (compiles) your program to something that the Arduino can execute.
1. plumb then takes the transformed file and uploads it to your Arduino.

### Get The Software

We have installable apps for Mac and Windows. Linux available upon request.

* [Windows (64-bit)](#FIXME)
* [Mac (64-bit)](#FIXME)

### Getting Help

You can use the "Help" option in plumb (either in the command-line or GUI version), or you can join the [users@concurrency.cc](#FIXME) mailing list. We're always excited to help new occam programmers get started.

Also, check out [these books](#FIXME), which will help you get started with occam and the Plumbing libraries.

### Contributing

Join us on the [developers@concurrency.cc](#FIXME) mailing list to ask about how you can contribute. 

* occam-pi libraries to support specific hardware, or to provide useful utilities are always welcome.

* Documentation is always welcome. The wiki associated with this Github repository contains the help for plumb, and contributors only need a (free) Github account to help improve the docs.

* Racket (nee Scheme) hackers are welcome to contribute to the plumb client or server.

* Autotools experts are welcome to help with the build system.
