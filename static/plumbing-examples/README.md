=================

Examples for embedding into the plumb, the WWW site, and other documentation.

We recommend grabbing [plumb][download], our tool for programming in the Arduino in occam, and testing these out. [plumb][download] has an "Examples" menu where you can explore these interactively and try them out directly on your Arduino.
