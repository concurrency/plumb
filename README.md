plumb
=======

### Summary

**plumb** runs occam programs on your Arduino. To use **plumb**, you must have an active Internet connection.

**plumb** runs programs on your Arduino through a sequence of steps:

1. Sending your code to a server.
1. The server transforms (compiles) your program to something that the Arduino can execute.
1. plumb then takes the transformed file and uploads it to your Arduino.

### Get The Software

We have installable apps for Mac and Windows. Linux available upon request.

### Getting Help

You can use the "Help" option in plumb (either in the command-line or GUI version), or you can join the [users@concurrency.cc](#FIXME) mailing list. We're always excited to help new occam programmers get started.

Also, check out [these books](#FIXME), which will help you get started with occam and the Plumbing libraries.
